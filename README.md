## Development Process

### 1. Game Architecture Design

- **Component Structure**

  - Implemented a modular component architecture separating UI, game logic, and 3D rendering
  - Created reusable components like `Button`, `Preloader`, and `Planet3D` for consistent UI elements
  - Developed a flexible routing system using React Router for seamless navigation between game states

- **State Management**
  - Implemented `GameContext` using React Context API for global state management
  - Managed game states including:
    - Current level progression
    - Sound settings
    - Score tracking
    - Save/load game functionality
  - Created custom hooks like `useExitConfirmation` for better user experience

### 2. 3D Environment Setup

- **Wormhole Creation**

  - Utilized Three.js for creating the immersive wormhole tunnel effect
  - Implemented custom geometry and materials for the tunnel path
  - Added dynamic lighting and particle effects for enhanced visuals

- **Visual Effects**

  - Integrated post-processing effects using `EffectComposer`:
    - Implemented `UnrealBloomPass` for the neon glow effect
    - Added fog effects for depth perception
    - Created custom shaders for the space environment
  - Optimized rendering performance with proper scene management

- **Obstacle System**
  - Developed procedurally generated obstacles
  - Implemented obstacle pooling for better performance
  - Created dynamic collision boundaries

### 3. Game Mechanics Implementation
